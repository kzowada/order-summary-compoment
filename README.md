## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

With this project I started using rem and em units instead of pixels as before. At first I had to get a grip of how they work but in the end it pays out because the site resize way better because of relative units instead of fixed units. I only used percentages for my widths and min-heigt with vh-Unit. I still didn't have a mobile first approach but with my next project I definitely start with it. I finished the project within a couple hours. The basic HTML was set up pretty fast as well es the look of all the elements. Only positioning took me a couple hours (2-3 hours) to make it look right.

### Continued development

I need to focus on a mobile first approach.
